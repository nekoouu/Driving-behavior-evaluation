• On a dataset that contains different driving styles like normal, slow, and aggressive.<br/>
• Through the Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors data.<br/>
• Introduced, visualized, and preprocessed the dataset.<br/>
• Employed different approaches for classification like Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive-Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM
with different kernels.<br/>
